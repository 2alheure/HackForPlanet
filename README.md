# Hack for Planet 2018

This repository is about the Hack for Planet 2018, featuring ECV Digital Paris, GoodPlanet and Elephants for Africa.  
The main topic is: Elephants.  
Actually, farmers in Botswana are having issues with elephants destroying their productions. They often come to kill these animals, eventhough the surviving of this gigantic species is dangerously threatened.  
  
That's why we need to find a solution, leading to less confrontation between humans and elephants.

## The solution

The solution stands in a low-tech alert system, based on dumb phones (such as Nokia 3310, really widespread in Botswana). When a farmer sees an elephants, he prevents the app, which prevents itself the other farmer, so they can anticipate and spread repulsive substances, to be able not to kill them.

## Our contribution in this repository

Our contribution is part of the Dataviz field. We deliver much data, presented into charts and any other useful way.  
The application takes into account multiple things: 
- Users have roles: Information is only accessible for the role it is supposed to be seen.
- Authentication is required: You cannot access to your account without this.
- Crucial permissions are isolated: One has the role to manage users whilst the other manages the alerts.
